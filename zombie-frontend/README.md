## How Zombie DNA Works [How](https://cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/1/chapter/1)
Zombie DNA is simple â€” it's a 16-digit integer, like:
```shell
8356281049284737
```
The first 2 digits map to the zombie's head type
The second 2 digits to the zombie's eyes,
```
Note: For this tutorial, we've kept things simple, and our zombies can have only 7 different types of heads (even though 2 digits allow 100 possible options). Later on we could add more head types if we wanted to increase the number of zombie variations.
```
For example DNA above are 83, then zombie's head type is 7. Calculate by 83 % 7 + 1 = 7

## Zombie detail
```
  let zombieDetails = {
    // first 2 digits make up the head. We have 7 possible heads, so % 7
    // to get a number 0 - 6, then add 1 to make it 1 - 7. Then we have 7
    // image files named "head1.png" through "head7.png" we load based on
    // this number:
    headChoice: dnaStr.substring(0, 2) % 7 + 1,
    // 2nd 2 digits make up the eyes, 11 variations:
    eyeChoice: dnaStr.substring(2, 4) % 11 + 1,
    // 6 variations of shirts:
    shirtChoice: dnaStr.substring(4, 6) % 6 + 1,
    // last 6 digits control color. Updated using CSS filter: hue-rotate
    // which has 360 degrees:
    skinColorChoice: parseInt(dnaStr.substring(6, 8) / 100 * 360),
    eyeColorChoice: parseInt(dnaStr.substring(8, 10) / 100 * 360),
    clothesColorChoice: parseInt(dnaStr.substring(10, 12) / 100 * 360),
    zombieName: name,
    zombieDescription: "A Level 1 CryptoZombie",
  }
```
